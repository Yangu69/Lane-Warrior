## Description
**Lane Warrior** is a 2D sidescrolling game where the player gets through the levels by eliminating approaching enemies. This is done by tapping on one of the 3 lanes in the right moment.

I'm taking care of all the programming side of the project. [@DawidKay](https://github.com/DawidKay/) is responsible for the art.

The game offers two game modes:
- Story Mode - Dialogues and bosses! After defeating certain amount of enemies, a boss with mechanics unique to each level shows up. The boss needs to be beaten in order to unlock the next level.
- Free Mode - Achieve higher scores! This mode spawns enemies infinitely, so no bosses this time. This mode is used for practice and showing the leaderboards who's the boss.

Games with customization options are always a nice find, so a shop system was created where the player can buy and equip different skins.

The game integrates such SDKs as:
- **Google Play Games Services:** For leaderboards, achievements, and cloud saves.
- **AdMob:** For ad system integration. Users can willingly watch ads to earn some coins or gain extra life after dying.
- **Spine:** For managing animation state and skins at runtime. Main character and the enemies were created and exported from Spine.
